# tweeple
Playing with tweepy to interact with Twitter objects in Python.  No license.  No promises.  No warranties.  No guarantees.  Just code and links and such.
Most of this is working as expected.  Some test cases still need to be built and validated.  Also need to build capability to fetch all tweets for a user, including specifying a minimum tweet ID (eg. for pulling new tweets via schedule).
playground/ contains test scripts from when I was trying to figure out how to work with tweepy objects.  Real stuff is in get_twitter_object.py.
